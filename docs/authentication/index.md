# Authentication

## Authentication

iumiCash REST APIs use [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) access tokens to authenticate requests. 
Your access token authorizes you to use the iumiCash REST API servers.

To call a REST API in your integration, you must exchange 
your **client_id** and **client_secret** for an access token.  

You can find your **client_id** and **client_secret** by logging in to iumiCash [development page]
or somehow (we can send them to your email etc.).
