# Introduction

iumiCash uses [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API for integration and data exchange with third-party systems such as those used by service providers, vendors and merchants.

The API uses standard verbs and returns HTTP response codes and JSON-encoded responses.

To get started with  iumiCash REST API, please contact iumiCash representatives to get registered, verified and to obtain API credentials. See [Introduction to vendors][introduction to vendors] for details.

Administrators of the third-party systems are required to provide the details of their systems to get whitelisted by iumiCash for API integration to function properly.
