# Order callback mechanism

## Why you need to configure callback?

When user completed/cancelled order flow, your backend needs to be notified about flow result.
So the iumiCash will send `POST` request to your [`callback_url`][callback url] with details.


## Callback data

Order information that the iumiCash will send to the vendor's [`callback_url`][callback url].

Callback data will contain [order object][order], so you can check order status in iumiCash.

This endpoint should return `200 OK` with content `OK`. Otherwise, the iumiCash will make retry
requests (see [retry policy]) until the vendor returns successful response, 
or the vendor consumed order data by yourself.

!!! note
    It required to make sure that the vendor processed order data.


## Callback request

The iumiCash backend will send `POST` request to `callback_url` with `iumicash-signature` header.

`POST` [`callback_url`][callback url]

### Request headers

???+ info "Header parameters"

    `iumicash-signature` *string*
    :   iumiCash will sign [order data][order] with [client_secret][client secret],
        so your backend can verify, that request was made by us. 
    :   !!! tip
            See [iumicash-signature][iumicash signature] for more information about signing.

    `Content-Type` *string*
    :   The media type. Required for operations with a request body. The value is `application/<format>`, where format is `json`.

### Request

In request the iumiCash send [Order data][order]. See more information in [example](#example) below.

### Response

!!! Info

    This endpoint should return `200 OK` with content `OK`. Otherwise, the iumiCash will make retry
    requests (see [retry policy]) while the vendor returns successfull response. 

    It is required to make sure that the vendor processes order data.


### Example

???+ example "Examples"

    === "Request"

        Example request with cURL that the iumiCash backend will send to your [`callback_url`](#callback-data).

        ```bash
        curl -v -X POST https://starlink.com/api/v1/iumiCash/callback/ \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "iumicash-signature: <some-calculated-order-specific-signature>" \
        -d ' \
        {
          "id": "542c2b97bac0595474108b48",
          "external_id": "123456",
          "created_at": "2022-09-12T13:27:09.860466",
          "updated_at": "2022-09-12T13:27:09.860466",
          "status": "created",
          "items": [
            {
              "name": "T-shirt",
              "description": "Brand new T-shirt",
              "amount": {
                "value": 100,
                "currency_code": "USD"
              },
              "count": 1
            }
          ],
          "application_context": {
            "callback_url": "https://starlink.com/api/v1/iumiCash/callback/"
            "success_url": "https://starlink.com/success.html",
            "error_url": "https://starlink.com/error.html"
          },
          "links": [
            {
              "link": "https://api.iumi.cash/api/v1/orders/542c2b97bac0595474108b48/",
              "rel": "self",
              "method": "get"
            }
          ]
        }
        '
        ```

    === "Response"

        A successful request have to return the `HTTP 200 OK` status code and `OK` content.

        ```python
        def post(request: Request) -> Response:
            iumicash_signature = request.headers.get("iumicash-signature")
            order_data = request.data
            ...
            some business logic and validation
            ...
            return Response(data="OK", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
        ```

### iumiCash Signature

iumiCash will sign [order data][order] with [client_secret][client secret].
In callback endpoint you can sign received order data with your `client_secret` and verify
that this request was made by original iumiCash.

To verify request, simply compare the next values: 

* `iumicash-signature` from request headers.
* your result after signing [order data][order] with [client_secret][client secret]

!!! note "Algorithm"
    The sign algorithm is [`HMAC-SHA256`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC), where data is request's body,
    secret cryptographic key is vendor's [`client_secret`][client secret]

!!! example "Signature comparing"

    ```python
    import os
    import hashlib
    import hmac

    client_secret = os.environ.get("CLIENT_SECRET")

    data = response.content
    signature = response.headers['iumicash-signature']
    signature_computed = hmac.new(
        key=client_secret.encode('utf-8'),
        msg=data.encode('utf-8'),
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    if not hmac.compare_digest(signature, signature_computed):
        print("Signature not valid! Request was malicious!")

    ```

!!! warning "Security note"

    If they equals, then request was made by original iumiCash.

    If not, request was compromised by others, and you should **reject** this request.

### Retry policy

The iumiCash uses [Exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) algorithm 
to notify your [callback url].

An exponential backoff algorithm retries requests exponentially, 
increasing the waiting time between retries up to a maximum backoff time. 
For example:

1. Make a callback request.
2. If the request fails, wait 1 + `random_number_milliseconds` seconds and retry the request.
3. If the request fails, wait 2 + `random_number_milliseconds` seconds and retry the request.
4. If the request fails, wait 4 + `random_number_milliseconds` seconds and retry the request.
5. And so on, up to a `maximum_backoff` time.
6. Continue waiting and retrying up to some maximum number of retries, 
but do not increase the wait period between retries.

where:

`wait time`
:   $$
    min(((2^n)+random\_number\_milliseconds), maximum\_backoff)
    $$

    with n incremented by 1 for each iteration (request).

`random_number_milliseconds`
:   is a random number of milliseconds less than or equal to 1000. 
    This helps to avoid cases in which many clients are synchronized by some situation
    and all retry at once, sending requests in synchronized waves. 
    The value of `random_number_milliseconds` is recalculated after each retry request.

`maximum_backoff` 
:   is typically $2^{22}$ seconds (~1.6 months). The appropriate value depends on the use case.
