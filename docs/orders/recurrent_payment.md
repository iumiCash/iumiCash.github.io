# Recurrent payments

The logic of recurrent payments is similar to single payments, that is, 
the responsibility for sending a request for weekly, monthly or any other 
period of time for creating an order lies on a vendor's side.

See [One-Time Payment](create_order.md) for more details about order creating.
