# Recurrent payments

Recurrent payments are triggered by the vendor’s system and are processed by 
iumiCash the same way the one-time payments are executed. The responsibility 
for initiating recurrent payment requests at the right time for the correct 
items (services, products, etc.) and amounts lies on the vendor’s side.

See [One-Time Payment](create_order.md) for more details about order creation.
