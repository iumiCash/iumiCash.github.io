# Introduction to vendors

A `Vendor` is a third-party system integrated with iumiCash for the purpose of using iumiCash as one of the payment methods.

Instructions on how to implement iumiCash as a payment method:

* Get `client_id`, `client_secret` from iumiCash by applying to a iumiCash representative.
    * Register own application in iumiCash system. See more information in [*Registration page*](vendor_registration.md).
    * Contact with *andrew.taylor@iumi.cash* for providing `client_id`, `client_secret`.


* *(Optional)* Request a iumiCash representative to apply `Verified` status to the vendorâ€™s account.


* To create order, see flow diagrams: [One-Time Payment][one_time_diagrams] / [Recurrent Payment][recurrent_diagram].
