# User specific settings for the vendors

After obtaining end-user's [refresh token], the vendor can use them without restrictions,
because they have infinite lifetime, so a vendor can infinitely refresh end-user's [access token].

To prevent any unintended actions at vendor's side, end-user can configure and restrict 
some parameters in [registered applications] page.

* Money limit per transaction
* Max monthly transaction count limit
*
