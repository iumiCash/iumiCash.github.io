# Vendor registration

## Registration

To use the iumiCash REST API, the vendor must first register by applying to a iumiCash representative. 
After registration, the vendor will receive a pair of `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials as well as API URL.

## Whitelisting

For additional security, iumiCash may require vendors to provide the details of their systems 
(such as IP addresses, domain names, etc.), which will be added to iumiCash API whitelists.

!!! warning "Security tip"

    Be careful! Do not expose your **client_secret** and other confidential data related to iumiCash to others.
