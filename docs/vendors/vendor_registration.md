# Vendor registration

## Registration

To use the iumiCash REST API, you need to register vendor by applying to a iumiCash representative. 
After registration, the vendor will receive a pair of `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials.

## Whitelisting

For additional security, iumiCash may require vendors to provide the details of their systems 
(such as IP addresses, domain names, etc.), which will be added to iumiCash API whitelists.

!!! warning "Security tip"

    Be careful, do not expose your **client_secret** to others
